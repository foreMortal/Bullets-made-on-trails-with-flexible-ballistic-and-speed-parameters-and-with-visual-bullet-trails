This script meant to control bullets from two weapons that player can switch.
Bullets trails in this implementation is only a visual indicator and all collision logic based an rails.
This script was designed to let you count collision for bullets that been fired exactly from the center of the screen and create a visual indicator as a bullet trail that fires from your weapon muzzle.
The trail indicates pretty close path to that actual bullet(the bullet that counts collisions) flew.
It is working pretty close to Apex Legends bullets and trails system.
